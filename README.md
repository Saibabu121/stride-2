A stride 2 conv with the default padding (1) and ks (3) will reduce the activation map dimension by half. Formula: (n + 2*pad - ks)//stride + 1. As the activation map dimension reduces by half we double the number of filters. This results in no overall change in computation as the network gets deeper and deeper.
